# SharpNetSH
A simple netsh library for C#

#####NuGet Installation:

    Install-Package SharpNetSH

This library is designed to provide easy access to the NetSH tool from inside of your C# application.  Currently the library only supports some NetSH contexts, but other contexts will be added in to support the remainder of the functionality as time permits.  See the table below for information on what is supported currently.
