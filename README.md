# SharpNetSH
A simple netsh library for C#

#####This is version 2.0, and theoretically should work with all NetSH commands, however I have not yet tested them all and only some of the methods can return back values

###TODO

- Allow multiple harnesses to be registered and retain registration order
- Finish ShowAction responses
- Finish AddAction responses
- Finish DeleteAction responses
- Need to handle error cases (like adding an existing IP Address to Http.Add.IpListen)
